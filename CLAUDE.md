## Unified Agent Workflow

| Phase | Step | Agent(s) | Output |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| **Requirements** | 1 | @requirements | Elicit and document requirements (ISO 29148) → `requirement-docs/` |
| **Orchestration** | 2 | @task-manager | **Orchestrates all remaining phases (2-17). Sole activity log writer.** |
| **Architecture** | 3 | @architect | Architectural decisions, ADRs → `project-docs/adrs/` |
| **Design** | 4 | @requirements-analyzer | Parse requirements structure |
| | 5 | @design-orchestrator | Coordinate specialized design agents |
| | 5a | └─ Foundation | @ui-ux-design, @data-design, @security-design (parallel) |
| | 5b | └─ Core | @library-design, @backend-design (parallel) |
| | 5c | └─ Application | @frontend-design, @agent-design (parallel) |
| | 5d | └─ Integration | @integration-design |
| | 5e | └─ Infrastructure | @infrastructure-design |
| | | | Output: `design-docs/` with prefixed documents |
| **Planning** | 6 | @test-designer, @data-agent | Plan tests; define schemas (parallel) |
| | 6a | @task-manager | Create task list |
| **Implementation** | 7 | @developer(s) | Implement code |
| **Review** | 8 | Code reviewers (3) | @code-reviewer-requirements, @code-reviewer-security, @code-reviewer-integration (parallel) |
| | 8a | @task-manager | Collect findings into tracker (CR-IDs), route each to correct agent |
| | 8b | @test-designer | Assess findings for test impact, update test plan |
| | 9 | Routed agents | Fix findings: @architect / @design-orchestrator / @developer as appropriate |
| | 9a | @task-manager | Record resolutions in findings tracker |
| | 10 | Code reviewers (re-review) | Verify fixes, check for new issues (only reviewers that had findings) |
| | 10a | Loop to Step 9 | If still-open or new findings, until all verified |
| **Test Prep** | 11 | @test-designer | Review/update test plan |
| | 12 | @documentation, @deployment | Docs and env setup (parallel) |
| **Testing** | 13 | @test-coder → @test-runner | Write & run tests |
| | 14 | @test-debugger | On failure: diagnose |
| | 15 | @task-manager → Agent | Route fix |
| | 16 | Loop to Step 13 | Until all pass |
| **Finalize** | 17 | @documentation | Final updates |

**Do NOT duplicate design documents for each work item.** Create work-specific docs (`{seq}-requirements-*.md`, `{seq}-design-*.md`) but update foundational docs (01-, 02-, 03-, etc.) in place. See design-orchestrator.md for the full update pattern.

---

## Key Decisions & Concepts

1. **Task Manager as Sole Writer** - Only Task Manager modifies task lists
2. **Schemas as Source of Truth** - Data Agent maintains authoritative schemas
3. **Convention Files** - Developer/Test Coder load language-specific conventions
4. **Design Templates** - Comprehensive templates for each component type
5. **Mid-Task Requests** - Agents can request work; Task Manager queues
6. **Test Runner Routing** - Routes failures to appropriate agents
7. **No Dates** - All documents are timeless
8. **Environment Isolation** - NEVER pollute the host machine's global environment (see below)

---

## CRITICAL: Environment Isolation

**NEVER install packages, dependencies, or tools globally on the host machine.**

| Language | Isolation Method | Setup Command |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Python | Virtual environment | `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Node.js | Local node_modules | `npm install` (no -g flag) |
| Ruby | Bundler with path | `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'` |
| Go | Go modules | `go mod init` (default behavior) |
| Rust | Cargo (project-local) | Default behavior |
| Java | Maven/Gradle (project-local) | Default behavior |

**Python:** Always create venv before any `pip install`. Never use `sudo pip install`. Add `.venv/`, `__pycache__/` to `.gitignore`.
**Node.js:** Never use `npm install -g` or `yarn global add`. Use `npx` for CLI tools. Add `node_modules/` to `.gitignore`.
**Enforcement:** Deployment Agent sets up environment before installs. Developer Agent verifies environment is active. Test agents use project environment.

---

## CRITICAL: Memory MCP Protocol — ALL Agents

**Every agent MUST execute Memory MCP operations on every invocation. This is not optional. Agents that skip memory operations produce orphaned work that other agents cannot find, reuse, or validate.**

### On Start — BEFORE Any Work

**Step 1 of every agent's workflow is reading CLAUDE.md. Step 2 is searching memory.** No agent may begin its primary work without first executing:

```
memory_search(query: "{task-relevant terms}", memory_types: ["code_pattern", "design", "component"])
```

Specifically:
- **Search `code_pattern`** — find registered patterns from similar components. If a similar component exists, follow its patterns exactly.
- **Search `design`** — find prior decisions that constrain your work. Do not contradict existing ADRs or design decisions.
- **Search `component`** — find registered components, schemas, and specs. Do not duplicate or conflict with existing components.
- **Use `code_search()`** — for implementation agents (Developer, Test Coder), find actual code to use as archetypes.

**If you find existing patterns, USE them. Do not reinvent what already exists.**

### On Complete — AFTER All Work

**The last step of every agent's workflow (before returning Task Result) is indexing work in memory.** No agent may return its Task Result without first executing:

1. **Index every file created or modified:**
   ```
   index_file(file_path: "{path}", language: "{lang}")
   ```
   For directories of documentation:
   ```
   index_docs(directory_path: "{dir}", patterns: ["**/*.md"])
   ```

2. **Store significant results and decisions:**
   ```
   memory_add(memory_type: "{appropriate_type}", content: "{summary of work}", metadata: {"work_seq": "{seq}", ...})
   ```

### Enforcement

- Every agent's `<log-entry>` block MUST include a `"memory_ops"` field confirming what was searched and what was indexed
- Task Manager validates that `memory_ops` is present in agent results — missing memory operations are flagged as incomplete work
- All agent success criteria include memory operation checkboxes — **these are mandatory exit criteria, not decorative suggestions**
- If an agent completes work but did not search memory first or index its output, the work is considered incomplete even if all other criteria pass

---

## Requirement ID Conventions

Requirements include the sequence number to link them to specific work items.

| Pattern | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| `STK-{SEQ}-NNN` | Stakeholder | STK-002-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-FN-NNN` | Functional | REQ-002-FN-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-INT-UI-NNN` | UI Interface | REQ-002-INT-UI-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-INT-API-NNN` | API Interface | REQ-002-INT-API-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-DATA-NNN` | Data | REQ-002-DATA-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-PERF-NNN` | Performance | REQ-002-NFR-PERF-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-SEC-NNN` | Security | REQ-002-NFR-SEC-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-ACC-NNN` | Accessibility | REQ-002-NFR-ACC-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-AVAIL-NNN` | Availability | REQ-002-NFR-AVAIL-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-VER-NNN` | Verification | REQ-002-VER-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-DEP-NNN` | Deployment | REQ-002-DEP-001 |

**Note:** `{SEQ}` is the 3-digit sequence number from Current Work (e.g., 001, 002).

## Document Sequence Tracker

| Seq | Short Name | Component | Requirements | Design | Task List | Status |
|-----|------------|-----------|--------------|--------|-----------|--------|

---

## Commands

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `initialize` | Reset project, ask what to build |
| `new work` | Start new work item with fresh sequence, interview for requirements |
| `lets begin` | Check requirements, collect if missing, get approval, start workflow |
| `continue` | Resume current work from task list |
| `list components` | Show all components from COMPONENTS.md (supports type filtering) |
| `target {id}` | Set active component for subsequent work |
| `show component {id}` | Display full details of a component |
| `add component` | Interactively add a component to COMPONENTS.md |
| `impact {id}` | Show components affected by changes to target |
| `untarget` | Clear the active component targeting |

### `initialize` Workflow

When user says `initialize`, perform these actions **before** asking what to build:

1. **Reset Current Work section** to blank state (Seq/Name = pending, Status = Not Started, Phase = Awaiting Requirements)
2. **Reset README.md** to minimal template with project name placeholder
3. **Reset Document Sequence Tracker** - Clear all rows except header
4. **Clear project artifacts** (if they exist):
   - Delete files in `requirement-docs/` (except `README.md` and `_sample-requirements.md`)
   - Delete files in `design-docs/` (except templates)
   - Delete files in `project-docs/` (except `adrs/` folder structure)
   - Clear `project-docs/activity.log` if it exists
   - **Do NOT delete `COMPONENTS.md`** -- preserved across resets
5. **After all resets complete**, ask: "What would you like to build?"

### `new work` Workflow

Creates a new work item without resetting existing project artifacts.

1. **Determine next sequence number** from Document Sequence Tracker (3-digit zero-padded, e.g., 001 → 002 → 003)
2. **Prompt for work description**, generate `short_name` (lowercase, hyphens, max 30 chars), confirm with user
3. **Check for component targeting** (if `COMPONENTS.md` exists, ask if work is for a specific component)
4. **Update Current Work section** in CLAUDE.md with new seq, short_name, status=Requirements Gathering. If component-scoped, add Component field and Component Context sub-section (see Component Context rules below)
5. **If component-scoped**, update component status to `active` in `COMPONENTS.md` (both Summary table and detail section) — follows the Component Status Lifecycle
6. **Update Document Sequence Tracker** with new row (seq, short_name, component if targeted, status=Requirements)
7. **Create requirements document scaffold** in `requirement-docs/` with ISO 29148 structure
8. **Ask user about requirements source:** upload/paste OR interview
9. **If interview selected**, invoke @requirements agent for elicitation

### `lets begin` Workflow

1. **Check for requirements** in `requirement-docs/` (skip README.md and _sample-requirements.md)
2. **If no requirements exist:** Invoke @requirements agent to collect interactively
3. **If requirements exist:** Present summary, ask user for approval. If no, allow modifications
4. **Once approved:** Update Current Work, **invoke @task-manager** to orchestrate all remaining phases (steps 2-17 of Unified Agent Workflow)

**Important:** Task Manager is the orchestrator from step 2 onward. Do NOT invoke @architect or design agents directly — Task Manager invokes them so that all agent actions are logged to the activity log.

### `continue` Workflow

Resumes work from the current task list. **Task Manager is the primary coordinator for all resumed work.**

1. **Invoke @task-manager** to coordinate ALL continued work
2. Task Manager loads CLAUDE.md context, task list, activity log, and Component Context if present
3. Resets any stale `in-progress` tasks to `pending` (interrupted session)
4. Finds next actionable `pending` task with all dependencies `complete`
5. Routes task to correct agent, passing component context if present
6. Updates task list and activity log immediately on completion
7. Repeats until all tasks complete, user intervention required, or phase transition needed

**Important:** Always use `continue` to let Task Manager coordinate. Do not invoke individual agents directly.

---

### Component Status Lifecycle

Components follow a three-state lifecycle:

```
pending → active → complete
```

| Status | Meaning | Transition Trigger |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `pending` | Registered but no work started | Set on `add component` |
| `active` | Currently being worked on | Set on `target {id}` or `new work` (when component-scoped) |
| `complete` | All work finished, tests passing | Set by Task Manager when all tasks for the component are done |

**Rules:**
- `add component` always sets status to `pending`
- `target {id}` sets status to `active` (component is now being worked on)
- `new work` sets status to `active` when the work item is scoped to a component
- Task Manager sets status to `complete` when the component's work item finishes all phases (implementation, review, testing all pass)
- `untarget` does NOT revert status — once `active`, it stays `active` until completed
- A `complete` component can be re-targeted for new work (status returns to `active`)

### Component Commands

Component commands require `COMPONENTS.md` at the project root. If absent: "No COMPONENTS.md found. Create one with `add component` or manually. See `COMPONENTS.EXAMPLE.md` for the expected format."

| Canonical Command | Also Recognized As |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `list components` | "show all components", "what components exist", "show components" |
| `target {id}` | "work on {id}", "switch to {id}", "focus on {id}" |
| `show component {id}` | "tell me about {id}", "what is {id}", "describe {id}" |
| `add component` | "register a component", "new component", "create component" |
| `impact {id}` | "what depends on {id}", "blast radius of {id}", "who uses {id}" |
| `untarget` | "clear component", "stop targeting", "unfocus" |

### `list components`

1. Check `COMPONENTS.md` exists, read and validate manifest
2. Display table with columns: ID, Name, Type, Path, Status
3. Apply type filter if specified (e.g., "list agent components")
4. Display count summary by type

### `target {id}`

1. Look up `## {id}` in `COMPONENTS.md`. If not found, show valid IDs and suggest closest match
2. Extract all fields from component's detail section
3. **Update component status to `active`** in both the Summary table and the detail section of `COMPONENTS.md`
4. Write `**Component:** {id}` to Current Work (after Name, before Status)
5. Write `### Component Context` sub-section with hydrated metadata
6. Display component details. If already targeted, previous target is replaced silently

### `show component {id}`

1. Look up `## {id}` in `COMPONENTS.md`. If not found, show valid IDs
2. Extract all fields, compute reverse dependencies, check for associated docs
3. Display full component details including dependencies and dependents

### `add component`

1. If `COMPONENTS.md` doesn't exist, offer to create it
2. Prompt for required fields: ID (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,39}`), Name, Type (frontend/backend/library/agent/gateway/infrastructure/other), Path, Description
3. Prompt for optional fields: Language, Dependencies, Deployment, Port, Owner
4. Validate ID uniqueness and format, warn on unknown dependency references
5. Set Status to `pending` (do NOT prompt for status — it follows the lifecycle automatically)
6. Add row to Summary table and new H2 section to `COMPONENTS.md`
7. **MANDATORY: Store component in memory:**
   ```
   memory_add(memory_type: "component", content: "Component {id}: {name}. Type: {type}. Path: {path}. Description: {description}. Language: {language}. Dependencies: {dependencies}. Status: pending.", metadata: {"component_id": "{id}", "component_type": "{type}", "path": "{path}", "language": "{language}"})
   ```
8. Ask about scaffolding the source directory

### `impact {id}`

1. Look up `## {id}` in `COMPONENTS.md`. If not found, show valid IDs
2. BFS on reverse dependency graph: find direct dependents, then transitive dependents (track visited nodes for cycles)
3. Display direct and transitive dependents with total count

### `untarget`

1. If no `**Component:**` field in Current Work, display "No component is currently targeted."
2. Remove `**Component:**` line and `### Component Context` sub-section, preserve all other fields

### Component Context Rules

When a component is targeted, Current Work gains `**Component:** {id}` (after Name, before Status) and a `### Component Context` sub-section with a metadata table from COMPONENTS.md.

1. Field is omitted entirely when no component is targeted (backward compatible)
2. Only fields with values are included
3. When a different component is targeted, previous context is replaced
4. `untarget` removes both the field and the sub-section
5. All agents read this section from CLAUDE.md to scope work — Developer uses Path/Language/Dependencies, Test agents use Path/Language, reviewers use Path/Dependencies, Task Manager uses all fields

---

## Model Configuration

**Default Model:** `opus` — Override in agent YAML front-matter with `model: sonnet` or `model: haiku`.

| Agent Category | Model | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Architecture, Security, Design, Code Reviewers, Task Manager | opus | Complex reasoning and trade-offs |
| Developer, Test Coder, Test Runner, Documentation | sonnet | Standard implementation work |
| Exploration, simple validation | haiku | Quick searches, simple transforms |

---

## Activity Log

Traceability of all agent actions. Designed for machine parsing. Full schema and writer protocol in task-manager.md.

- **File:** `project-docs/activity.log`
- **Format:** JSONL (one JSON object per line, UTF-8)
- **Sole Writer:** Task Manager (adds `log_seq`, `work_seq`, `timestamp`, `parent_log_seq`, `duration_ms` to agent entries)

### Action Types

| Action | Description | When to Log |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `START` | Agent began execution | When agent is invoked |
| `COMPLETE` | Agent finished successfully | When agent returns success |
| `ERROR` | Agent encountered an error | When agent fails |
| `DECISION` | Significant decision made | When architectural/design choice is made |
| `FILE_CREATE` | New file created | When a new file is written |
| `FILE_MODIFY` | Existing file modified | When an existing file is changed |
| `BLOCKED` | Agent blocked, waiting on dependency | When agent cannot proceed |
| `UNBLOCKED` | Agent unblocked, resuming work | When blocking condition resolved |
| `REVIEW_PASS` | Code review passed | When reviewer approves |
| `REVIEW_FAIL` | Code review failed | When reviewer finds issues |
| `TEST_PASS` | Test(s) passed | When test execution succeeds |
| `TEST_FAIL` | Test(s) failed | When test execution fails |

### Phase Values

`requirements` | `architecture` | `design` | `planning` | `implementation` | `review` | `testing` | `documentation` | `deployment`

---

## Parallel Execution

### Design Phase Waves

| Wave | Agents | Dependencies |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Foundation | UI-UX Design, Data Design, Security Design | None |
| Core | Library Design, Backend Design | Foundation complete |
| Application | Frontend Design, Agent Design | Core complete |
| Integration | Integration Design | Application complete |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure Design | Integration complete |

### Implementation Phase

Parallel Developer agents when: different source directories, no shared utility modifications, separate database tables.

### Testing Phase

Parallel test execution when: independent modules, no shared fixtures requiring sequential setup, database isolation per suite.

### Conflict Resolution

Task Manager detects file conflicts. First completion wins; subsequent agents rebase. Design doc conflicts escalated to user.

---

## Exit Criteria

Task Manager validates exit criteria before phase transitions. Blocks if not met. Allows user override with explicit acknowledgment.

| Phase | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Design** | All required design docs created, requirements traceability complete, no unresolved questions, user approval |
| **Implementation** | All code reviewers pass (no critical/high), no TODO/FIXME in committed code, no stubs, builds without errors, Conventional Commits |
| **Testing** | Coverage minimum 70% (configurable), all tests passing, no critical/high security findings, performance benchmarks met |
| **Documentation** | User docs complete, developer docs complete, API docs generated, README updated |

---

## Git Requirements

All projects must use Git for version control.

### Branch Strategy

| Branch Pattern | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `main` | Stable, protected - production-ready code |
| `feature/<task-id>-<short-desc>` | Per task/component implementation |
| `fix/<issue-id>-<short-desc>` | Bug fixes |

### Commit Format (Conventional Commits)

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

Refs: REQ-XXX-FN-NNN
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Conflict Resolution

1. Developer resolves conflicts following existing code patterns
2. Design doc conflicts escalated to user
3. Task Manager tracks conflict resolution status

---

## Memory Integration (MCP)

**Required Dependency:** [claude-code-project-memory-mcp](https://github.com/osok/claude-code-project-memory-mcp) MCP server. Install and configure before using this framework.

### Memory Types

| Type | Purpose | Primary Writers | Primary Readers |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `requirements` | Stored requirements with IDs | Requirements Agent | All agents |
| `design` | Architectural decisions, patterns, ADRs | Architect, Design Agents | All agents |
| `code_pattern` | Indexed source code patterns | Developer, Test Coder | Developer, Test Coder |
| `component` | Component specs, schemas, API endpoints | Design Agents, Data Agent | All agents |
| `function` | Function-level code index | Auto-indexed | Developer, Test Coder |
| `test_history` | Test results, failures, diagnoses, reviews | Test Runner, Test Debugger, Reviewers | Test Agents, Task Manager |
| `session` | Session state, phase completions | Task Manager | Task Manager |
| `user_preference` | User preferences and customizations | User interactions | All agents |

### Memory Operations Reference

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `memory_search` | Semantic search across memories — use before any work |
| `memory_add` / `memory_bulk_add` | Store new memory(s) — after completing significant work |
| `memory_get` / `memory_update` | Retrieve or update by ID |
| `find_duplicates` | Find near-duplicate memories — before adding |
| `get_design_context` | Get design decisions for a component |
| `trace_requirements` | Trace requirements to implementations |
| `code_search` | Find similar code patterns |
| `check_consistency` | Validate code follows established patterns |
| `validate_fix` | Validate fix against design |
| `index_file` / `index_directory` | Index source files for code_search |
| `memory_statistics` | Check system health |
| `normalize_memory` | Deduplicate and consolidate |
| `export_memory` / `import_memory` | Backup and restore |
| `graph_query` / `get_related` / `reindex` | Advanced graph queries and reindexing |

### Code Consistency Enforcement

All code must look like it was designed and developed by one person. Components of the same type must follow identical patterns.

1. **Pattern Conformance** — Search memory for existing components of the same type; follow their structure exactly
2. **Base Class Reuse** — Never reimplement functionality from base classes or shared utilities
3. **Structural Uniformity** — Same file organization, constructors, lifecycle methods, configuration
4. **Naming Consistency** — Follow conventions established by the first component of that type

See developer.md for detailed enforcement steps. Code reviewers flag structural mismatches, base class reimplementation, and naming/organization deviations.

### Memory Best Practices

- Search before creating (avoid duplicates)
- Use specific queries with requirement IDs and component names
- Store actionable data with `work_seq` and category metadata
- Index new source files after creating them
- Run `normalize_memory` periodically

### Memory Initialization

**On `initialize`:** Check `memory_statistics()`, index codebase with `index_directory`, store project overview and user preferences.
**On `continue`:** Search for last session state (`memory_types: ["session"]`), load context for current phase.

## Working Principles

- Blunt, honest feedback over false agreement
- Right matters more than feelings
- Keep markdown lean - enough for intent, no more
- Document decisions and rationale
