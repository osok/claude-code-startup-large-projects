# Claude Code Sub-Agents Project

A collection of specialized sub-agents for the complete software development lifecycle: requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment.

---

## Current Work

<!-- This section tracks active work. Clear when complete. -->

**Seq:** 001
**Name:** Framework Enhancements v2
**Status:** Complete

**Task List:** [TASK-LIST-framework-enhancements.md](TASK-LIST-framework-enhancements.md)

**Current Phase:** All Phases Complete

**Summary:** Comprehensive enhancements including model configuration, activity logging, git integration, CI/CD, observability, exit criteria, secrets management, dependency policies, environment parity, database migrations, and parallelism documentation.

We are NOT using this workflow of agents to build anything. Rather they are the project. This will be used as a template for future development. All tasks in the task-list have been completed.

| 60- | Infrastructure | @infrastructure-design |
| 90- | UI/UX designs | @ui-ux-design |

### Design Document Strategy

**Do NOT duplicate design documents for each work item.** Instead:

1. **Work-specific documents** (created per work item):
   - `requirement-docs/{seq}-requirements-{short_name}.md` - Requirements for this work
   - `design-docs/{seq}-design-{short_name}.md` - Design overview for this work

2. **Foundational documents** (updated, not duplicated):
   - `design-docs/01-style-guide.md` - Single style guide, updated as needed
   - `design-docs/02-data-architecture.md` - Single data architecture, updated
   - `design-docs/03-security-architecture.md` - Single security doc, updated
   - All other prefixed docs (10-, 20-, 30-, etc.) - Updated to incorporate new work

**Update Pattern:**
- Design agents check if foundational doc exists
- If exists: Add new sections/updates for current work, preserve existing content
- If not exists: Create the foundational doc
- Reference the work sequence in updates: "Added for Seq {NNN}: {short_name}"

**Example:** When adding user authentication (Seq 002):
- CREATE: `002-requirements-user-auth.md`, `002-design-user-auth.md`
- UPDATE: `02-data-architecture.md` (add User entity), `03-security-architecture.md` (add auth model)

## Key Decisions & Concepts

1. **Task Manager as Sole Writer** - Only Task Manager modifies task lists
2. **Schemas as Source of Truth** - Data Agent maintains authoritative schemas
3. **Convention Files** - Developer/Test Coder load language-specific conventions
4. **Design Templates** - Comprehensive templates for each component type
5. **Mid-Task Requests** - Agents can request work; Task Manager queues
6. **Test Runner Routing** - Routes failures to appropriate agents
7. **No Dates** - All documents are timeless
8. **Environment Isolation** - NEVER pollute the host machine's global environment (see below)

---

## CRITICAL: Environment Isolation

**NEVER install packages, dependencies, or tools globally on the host machine.**

This protects the user's local development environment from corruption, version conflicts, and unintended side effects.

### Required Isolation by Language

| Language | Isolation Method | Setup Command |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Python | Virtual environment | `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Node.js | Local node_modules | `npm install` (default behavior, no -g flag) |
| Ruby | Bundler with path | `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'` |
| Go | Go modules | `go mod init` (default behavior) |
| Rust | Cargo (project-local) | Default behavior |
| Java | Maven/Gradle (project-local) | Default behavior |

### Python-Specific Requirements

1. **Always create venv first** before any pip install:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

2. **Never use** `pip install` without an active venv
3. **Never use** `sudo pip install`
4. **Add to .gitignore**: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `__pycache__/`

### Node.js-Specific Requirements

1. **Never use** `npm install -g` or `yarn global add`
2. Use `npx` for CLI tools instead of global installs
3. **Add to .gitignore**: `node_modules/`

### Enforcement

- Deployment Agent must set up project environment before any installs
- Developer Agent must verify environment is active before installing
- Test agents must use project environment for test execution

---

## Requirement ID Conventions

Requirements include the sequence number to link them to specific work items.

| Pattern | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| `STK-{SEQ}-NNN` | Stakeholder | STK-002-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-FN-NNN` | Functional | REQ-002-FN-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-INT-UI-NNN` | UI Interface | REQ-002-INT-UI-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-INT-API-NNN` | API Interface | REQ-002-INT-API-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-DATA-NNN` | Data | REQ-002-DATA-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-PERF-NNN` | Performance | REQ-002-NFR-PERF-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-SEC-NNN` | Security | REQ-002-NFR-SEC-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-ACC-NNN` | Accessibility | REQ-002-NFR-ACC-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-NFR-AVAIL-NNN` | Availability | REQ-002-NFR-AVAIL-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-VER-NNN` | Verification | REQ-002-VER-001 |
| `REQ-{SEQ}-DEP-NNN` | Deployment | REQ-002-DEP-001 |

**Note:** `{SEQ}` is the 3-digit sequence number from Current Work (e.g., 001, 002).

---

## Document Sequence Tracker

| Seq | Short Name | Requirements | Design | Task List | Status |
|-----|------------|--------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 001 | Framework Enhancements v2 | N/A | N/A | TASK-LIST-framework-enhancements.md | Complete |

---

## Commands

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `initialize` | Reset project, ask what to build |
| `new work` | Start new work item with fresh sequence, interview for requirements |
| `lets begin` | Check requirements, collect if missing, get approval, start workflow |
| `continue` | Resume current work from task list |

### `initialize` Workflow

When user says `initialize`, perform these actions **before** asking what to build:

1. **Reset Current Work section** to blank state:
   ```markdown
   ## Current Work

   <!-- This section tracks active work. Clear when complete. -->

   **Seq:** (pending)
   **Name:** (pending)
   **Status:** Not Started

   **Task List:** (none)

   **Current Phase:** Awaiting Requirements

   **Summary:** (none)
   ```

2. **Reset README.md** to minimal template:
   ```markdown
   # Project Name

   (Project description will be added after requirements are defined)

   ## Getting Started

   See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for development workflow.
   ```

3. **Reset Document Sequence Tracker** - Clear all rows except header

4. **Clear project artifacts** (if they exist):
   - Delete files in `requirement-docs/` (except `README.md` and `_sample-requirements.md`)
   - Delete files in `design-docs/` (except templates)
   - Delete files in `project-docs/` (except `adrs/` folder structure)
   - Clear `project-docs/activity.log` if it exists

5. **After all resets complete**, ask: "What would you like to build?"

---

### `new work` Workflow

Creates a new work item without resetting existing project artifacts.

1. **Determine next sequence number:**
   - Read Document Sequence Tracker to find highest existing sequence
   - Increment by 1 (e.g., if highest is 001, new is 002)
   - Format as 3-digit zero-padded string

2. **Prompt for work description:**
   - Ask: "What is this work about? Provide a brief description."
   - From description, generate a `short_name` (lowercase, hyphens, max 30 chars)
   - Confirm short name with user: "Short name will be: `{short_name}`. OK?"

3. **Update CLAUDE.md Current Work section:**
   ```markdown
   ## Current Work

   <!-- This section tracks active work. Clear when complete. -->

   **Seq:** {new_seq}
   **Name:** {short_name}
   **Status:** Requirements Gathering

   **Task List:** (pending)

   **Current Phase:** Requirements

   **Summary:** {user's description}
   ```

4. **Create requirements document scaffold:**
   - Create `requirement-docs/{seq}-requirements-{short_name}.md`
   - Initialize with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 structure (empty sections)

5. **Ask user about requirements source:**
   - Option A: "I'll upload/paste my requirements" → User provides content, agent formats to ISO 29148
   - Option B: "Interview me to gather requirements" → Proceed to requirements interview

6. **If interview selected, conduct requirements elicitation:**
   - Focus on gathering information for each ISO 29148 section
   - See Requirements Interview Guide below

7. **Update Document Sequence Tracker** with new row

---

### Requirements Interview Guide

Structured interview to gather ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 compliant requirements. **No traceability matrix required.**

#### Phase 1: Introduction (Section 1)

1. **Purpose:** "What problem does this system solve? Who is it for?"
2. **Scope:** "What are the major components or modules?"
3. **Definitions:** "Are there domain-specific terms I should know?"

#### Phase 2: Stakeholders (Section 2)

1. **Users:** "Who will use this system? What are their roles?"
2. **Needs:** "What does each user type need to accomplish?"
3. **Constraints:** "Are there budget, timeline, or technology constraints?"

#### Phase 3: System Requirements (Section 3)

1. **Functional:** "What should the system DO? List the main features."
   - For each feature: "What are the acceptance criteria?"
   - Probe: "What happens on success? On failure? Edge cases?"
2. **Non-Functional:**
   - Performance: "Any speed or capacity requirements?"
   - Security: "Authentication? Authorization? Data protection needs?"
   - Accessibility: "WCAG compliance level needed?"
   - Availability: "Uptime requirements? Disaster recovery?"

#### Phase 4: Interfaces (Section 4)

1. **User Interfaces:** "Describe the screens or pages needed."
2. **API Interfaces:** "What APIs are needed? Who consumes them?"
3. **External Integrations:** "Any third-party systems to integrate with?"

#### Phase 5: Data (Section 5)

1. **Entities:** "What are the main data objects? (users, orders, etc.)"
2. **Relationships:** "How do these relate to each other?"
3. **Retention:** "Any data retention or deletion requirements?"

#### Phase 6: Verification (Section 7)

1. **Testing:** "What test coverage is expected?"
2. **Acceptance:** "How will you know the system is complete?"

#### Phase 7: Deployment (Section 8)

1. **Environments:** "Development, staging, production needs?"
2. **Infrastructure:** "Cloud provider? On-premise? Containerized?"

#### Interview Principles

- Ask one question at a time, wait for response
- Confirm understanding before moving to next topic
- Number requirements as they emerge (REQ-{SEQ}-FN-001, etc.)
- Each requirement: clear, testable, single concern
- Use priority labels: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have
- Continue until user confirms section is complete before moving on
- Update requirements document in real-time as answers come in

---

### `lets begin` Workflow

1. **Check for requirements** in `requirement-docs/`
   - Skip `README.md` and `_sample-requirements.md`
   - Look for actual project requirement documents

2. **If no requirements exist:**
   - Invoke @requirements agent
   - Interactively collect requirements from user
   - Create requirement document in `requirement-docs/`

3. **If requirements exist:**
   - Present summary of found requirements
   - Ask user: "Are these requirements approved to proceed?"
   - If no: Allow user to modify or add requirements
   - If yes: Continue to step 4

4. **Once approved:**
   - Update Current Work section with new sequence
   - Invoke @architect for architecture decisions
   - Continue through Unified Agent Workflow (steps 2-17)

---

## Model Configuration

**Default Model:** `opus`

Agents inherit the default model unless explicitly overridden in their YAML front-matter.

### Override Mechanism

In agent YAML front-matter:
```yaml
model: opus      # Use opus (default)
model: sonnet    # Override to sonnet
model: haiku     # Override to haiku
```

### Model Selection Guidance

| Model | Use For | Example Agents |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| opus | Complex reasoning, architecture, security analysis | Architect, Security Design, Requirements |
| sonnet | Standard coding, implementation, documentation | Developer, Test Coder, Documentation |
| haiku | Exploration, quick searches, simple transformations | Explore agents, simple validation |

### Recommendations by Agent Type

| Agent Category | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Architecture & Security | opus | Requires deep reasoning about trade-offs |
| Design Agents | opus | Complex design decisions |
| Developer | sonnet | Standard implementation work |
| Test Agents | sonnet | Test implementation and execution |
| Code Reviewers | opus | Thorough analysis required |
| Documentation | sonnet | Straightforward content generation |
| Task Manager | opus | Orchestration and decision-making |

| `architecture` | Architectural decisions and ADRs |
| `design` | Design document creation |
| `planning` | Test planning and task creation |
| `implementation` | Code implementation |
| `review` | Code review |
| `testing` | Test execution and debugging |
| `documentation` | Documentation creation/updates |
| `deployment` | Deployment and infrastructure |

### Log Entry Block Format

Agents emit log entries in this JSON format for Task Manager to append:

```json
<log-entry>
{
  "agent": "agent-name",
  "action": "COMPLETE",
  "phase": "implementation",
  "requirements": ["REQ-XXX-FN-001"],
  "task_id": "TASK-001",
  "details": "Brief description of what was done",
  "files_created": ["src/new-file.ts"],
  "files_modified": ["src/existing-file.ts"],
  "decisions": ["Chose X over Y because Z"],
  "errors": []
}
</log-entry>
```

**Note:** Agents do NOT include `seq`, `timestamp`, `parent_seq`, or `duration_ms` - Task Manager adds these when writing to the log.

### Log Writer Responsibility

Task Manager is the sole writer to `activity.log`:

1. **Initialize Log** - Create `project-docs/activity.log` if it doesn't exist
2. **Track Sequence** - Maintain global sequence counter across all entries
3. **Add Metadata** - Add `seq`, `timestamp`, `parent_seq`, `duration_ms` to agent entries
4. **Validate Entries** - Ensure all required fields are present
5. **Append Atomically** - Write complete JSON line (no partial writes)

### Example Log Entries

```jsonl
{"seq":1,"timestamp":"2024-03-15T10:30:00Z","agent":"task-manager","action":"START","phase":"implementation","parent_seq":null,"requirements":[],"task_id":null,"details":"Beginning implementation phase","files_created":[],"files_modified":[],"decisions":[],"errors":[],"duration_ms":null}

## Parallel Execution

Documents opportunities for concurrent agent execution to improve throughput.

### Design Phase (Supported)

| Wave | Agents | Dependencies |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Foundation | UI-UX Design, Data Design, Security Design | None |
| Core | Library Design, Backend Design | Foundation complete |
| Application | Frontend Design, Agent Design | Core complete |
| Integration | Integration Design | Application complete |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure Design | Integration complete |

### Implementation Phase

Multiple Developer agents can work in parallel when:
- Components have no shared file dependencies
- No circular import requirements
- Independent data models

**Independence Criteria:**
- Different source directories
- No shared utility modifications
- Separate database tables/collections

### Testing Phase

Parallel test execution when:
- Test suites target independent modules
- No shared test fixtures requiring sequential setup
- Database isolation per test suite

### Documentation Phase

| Parallel Work | Dependencies |
|---------------|--------------|
| User docs, Developer docs | None (can run concurrently) |
| API docs | Requires implementation complete |

### Merge/Integration Points

1. **After Design Phase** - All design docs reviewed for consistency
2. **After Implementation** - Integration testing validates connections
3. **After Testing** - Final documentation reflects tested behavior

### Conflict Resolution

1. Task Manager detects file conflicts in parallel work
2. First completion wins; subsequent agents rebase
3. Conflicting changes escalated to user for resolution

### Task Manager Coordination

- Tracks which agents are running in parallel
- Maintains dependency graph
- Blocks dependent work until prerequisites complete
- Reports parallel execution status to user

---

## Exit Criteria

Defines completion requirements for each workflow phase.

### Design Phase Exit Criteria

- [ ] All required design documents created (per Design Document Prefixes)
- [ ] Requirements traceability complete (all REQ-* IDs mapped)
- [ ] No unresolved design questions
- [ ] User approval obtained

### Implementation Phase Exit Criteria

- [ ] All code reviewers pass (no critical/high issues)
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME markers in committed code
- [ ] All interfaces implemented (no stubs)
- [ ] Code compiles/builds without errors
- [ ] Git commits follow Conventional Commits format

### Testing Phase Exit Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage minimum: 70% (configurable per project)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No critical/high security findings
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (if defined in requirements)

### Documentation Phase Exit Criteria

- [ ] User documentation complete
- [ ] Developer documentation complete
- [ ] API documentation generated
- [ ] README updated

### Exit Criteria Enforcement

Task Manager validates exit criteria before phase transitions:
1. Check all criteria for current phase
2. Block transition if criteria not met
3. Report specific failures to user
4. Allow user override with explicit acknowledgment

## Git Requirements

All projects must use Git for version control.

### Branch Strategy

| Branch Pattern | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `main` | Stable, protected - production-ready code |
| `feature/<task-id>-<short-desc>` | Per task/component implementation |
| `fix/<issue-id>-<short-desc>` | Bug fixes |

### Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

Refs: REQ-XXX-FN-NNN
```

### Commit Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| feat | New feature |
| fix | Bug fix |
| docs | Documentation only |
| style | Formatting, no code change |
| refactor | Code restructure, no behavior change |
| test | Adding/updating tests |
| chore | Build, tooling, dependencies |

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch Creation** - Developer creates feature branch when starting task
2. **Commits** - After implementation passes code review
3. **Additional Commits** - After test suite passes, after documentation updates
4. **Push** - Only when Task Manager instructs
5. **Merge** - Task Manager coordinates merges to main

### Conflict Resolution

1. Developer detects conflicts during rebase/merge
2. Developer resolves conflicts following existing code patterns
3. Conflicts in design docs escalated to user
4. Task Manager tracks conflict resolution status

## Working Principles

- Blunt, honest feedback over false agreement
- Right matters more than feelings
- Keep markdown lean - enough for intent, no more
- Document decisions and rationale
