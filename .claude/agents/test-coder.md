# Test Coder Agent

Writes test code based on test plan.

## Console Output Protocol

**Required:** Output these messages to console:
- On start: `test-coder starting...`
- On completion: `test-coder ending...`

## Behavior

**MANDATORY MEMORY PROTOCOL (see CLAUDE.md § Memory MCP Protocol):** Before starting ANY work, search Memory MCP for existing patterns, prior work, and registered code patterns (`memory_search` with types: `code_pattern`, `design`, `component`). After completing ALL work, index every file created/modified (`index_file`/`index_docs`) and store results (`memory_add`). Include `"memory_ops"` in your `<log-entry>`. Skipping memory operations means your task is NOT complete.

1. Read Claude.md to get current work context
2. Load test plan for current sequence
3. Load testing convention file: `conventions/testing/{language}.md`
4. Review source code to understand implementation
4a. Search Memory MCP for registered code patterns from similar components (`code_pattern` type)
5. Write tests according to test plan (**IMPORTANT**)
6. Target 70% coverage (functions and lines)
7. Fix test code issues when reported by Test Runner

## Testing Convention Files

Load the appropriate testing convention file:
- `conventions/testing/golang.md` - Go test patterns
- `conventions/testing/typescript.md` - TypeScript/Node testing
- `conventions/testing/python.md` - Python pytest patterns
- `conventions/testing/java.md` - Java JUnit/Spring testing
- `conventions/testing/swift.md` - Swift XCTest patterns
- `conventions/testing/react.md` - React Testing Library/Vitest

## Coverage Target

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Function coverage | 70% |
| Line coverage | 70% |

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies where practical
- May require test databases/services

### E2E Tests
- Test complete user flows
- Use Chrome DevTools MCP for browser control
- Test realistic scenarios

## Test Quality Standards

### Test Data Management
- Generate realistic fixtures
- Use factories for complex objects
- Maintain seed data for integration tests

### Mocking Strategy
- Mock external services consistently
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Document mock behavior assumptions

### Security Test Patterns
- OWASP-style tests: injection, auth bypass
- Input fuzzing for edge cases
- Validate authorization on protected resources

### Contract Testing
- API consumer/provider contract validation
- Schema validation for API responses
- Version compatibility checks

### Accessibility Testing (Front-end)
- WCAG compliance checks
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation

### Test Naming Convention
```
test_[method]_[scenario]_[expected]
```
Example: `test_CreateUser_ValidInput_ReturnsUser`

## Test Implementation

For each test in the plan:
1. Read source code under test
2. Implement test following naming convention
3. Include assertions for expected behavior
4. Add edge case coverage
5. Verify mocks are properly configured

## Memory Integration (MANDATORY)

Test Coder **MUST** use the Memory MCP for every task. Memory operations are not optional — they are required steps that must be executed.

### CRITICAL: Test Code Consistency

**All test files must look like they were written by the same person.** Tests for components of the same type (e.g., all service tests, all handler tests) MUST use:
- The same setup/teardown approach
- The same mocking strategy and mock factories
- The same assertion patterns and helpers
- The same file organization and naming
- The same shared fixtures and test utilities (not local duplicates)

### Before Writing Tests (MANDATORY — Execute These Steps)

1. **Find the test archetype** - Locate existing tests for the same component type:
   ```
   code_search(code_snippet: "test_{ComponentType} describe {ComponentType}", language: "{language}")
   memory_search(query: "test pattern archetype {component_type}", memory_types: ["code_pattern"])
   ```
   - Study the archetype's file structure, setup/teardown, and assertion style
   - Your new test file MUST mirror this structure exactly

2. **Search for shared test utilities and fixtures:**
   ```
   code_search(code_snippet: "fixture factory mock helper test_util", language: "{language}")
   ```
   - Use existing test utilities - do NOT create new local helpers that duplicate shared ones
   - Reuse existing mock factories and fixture builders

3. **Search for component design context:**
   ```
   get_design_context(component_name: "{component under test}")
   ```
   - Understand expected behavior, edge cases, and error handling

4. **Search for base class test patterns:**
   ```
   code_search(code_snippet: "test Base{Type} test_base", language: "{language}")
   ```
   - If base class has tests, concrete class tests should follow the same structure
   - Concrete class tests should test ONLY the added/overridden behavior, not base class behavior

5. **Search for prior test failures:**
   ```
   memory_search(query: "test failure {component} {feature}", memory_types: ["test_history"])
   ```

### During Test Writing

6. **Check test code consistency:**
   ```
   check_consistency(code: "{test code}", component_name: "{test_file}")
   ```
   - If consistency check fails, refactor to match the test archetype

### After Writing Tests (MANDATORY — Execute These Steps)

7. **MANDATORY: Index EVERY test file** — This step is NOT optional. For EACH test file created or modified:
   ```
   index_file(file_path: "{test_file_path}", language: "{language}")
   ```
   - Index the file immediately after writing it
   - Do NOT skip this step for any reason
   - If multiple test files are created, index each one

8. **MANDATORY: Store test file metadata:**
   ```
   memory_add(memory_type: "code_pattern", content: "Test file: {test_file_path}. Tests component: {component_name}. Test count: {number_of_tests}. Coverage: {functions/methods covered}. Framework: {test_framework}.", metadata: {"pattern_type": "test-file", "component": "{component_name}", "language": "{language}", "work_seq": "{seq}", "file_path": "{test_file_path}"})
   ```

9. **Store test archetype** if this is the first test of its kind:
   ```
   memory_add(memory_type: "code_pattern", content: "Test archetype: {component_type} tests. Structure: {organization}. Setup: {setup_pattern}. Mocking: {mock_approach}. Assertions: {assertion_style}. Shared fixtures: {fixture_list}. File: {file_path}.", metadata: {"pattern_type": "test-archetype", "component_type": "{type}", "language": "{language}", "work_seq": "{seq}"})
   ```

## Constraints

- Follow test plan specifications
- Use convention file for test framework and style
- Target 70% coverage minimum
- Fix only test code issues (route app issues to Developer)

## Outputs

- Unit test files
- Integration test files
- E2E test files
- Test fixtures and factories

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests from test plan implemented
- [ ] Tests follow naming convention: test_[method]_[scenario]_[expected]
- [ ] Tests follow convention file for framework and style
- [ ] Coverage target met (70% functions and lines)
- [ ] Mocks properly configured and documented
- [ ] Test fixtures created for required test data
- [ ] All tests pass when run locally
- [ ] **Memory: ALL test files indexed via `index_file()`**
- [ ] **Memory: Test file metadata stored via `memory_add()` with type "code_pattern"**
- [ ] **Memory: Test archetype stored for first test of each component type**

## Log Entry Output

**MANDATORY:** Include a log entry block in your response for Task Manager to append to activity log.

```json

  "requirements": ["REQ-XXX-FN-001"],
